This Internet of Things (IoT) application is designed to automatically neutralize unpleasant odors in washrooms by dispensing air freshener. The system detects foul odors and activates a spray mechanism, releasing air freshener until the odors are neutralized. This ensures that the washroom remains fresh without the need for manual intervention.

The process begins with sensors strategically placed in the washroom to monitor air quality continuously. When these sensors detect an increase in foul odors, they send a signal to the connected spray device. The device then dispenses a controlled amount of air freshener into the air. This continues until the sensors no longer detect the foul odor, indicating that the air has been neutralized.

The application can be programmed to work with various types of air fresheners and can be adjusted for different sizes of washrooms. Additionally, it offers the convenience of monitoring and controlling the system remotely through a smartphone app or a web interface. This IoT solution not only enhances the user experience by maintaining a pleasant washroom environment but also optimizes the use of air fresheners, making it both efficient and cost-effective.
